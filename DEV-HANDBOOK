~~~ Developers’ Handbook ~~~
* Basic rules
- always discuss your problem with other developers or with maintainer of the
  appropriate section
- stick with the project style and don’t import your own habits
- be present on developer’s IRC
- be inclusive: discuss your development efforts with others, keep everyone in
  the loop

* Git
- try to make clean commits (`git diff --staged` before commiting)
- break things into commits that make sense (`git add -p` to choose changes)
- push upstream only commits with changes you want to record forever in the
  repository
- write descriptive commit messages
- use .git/info/exclude to ignore your personal stuff, .gitignore to ignore
  general files that most people will have in their tree

* Filenames and identifiers
- keep letters small
- if you need more words in a name, use the underscore character (_)
- name them reasonably
- don’t use global variables unless *really* needed
- if you create new source files, copy the standard header comment in there

* Documentation
- always accompany your code with comments so that others can read it without
  spending time on figuring out what it is meant to do
- document functions and structures with doxygen comments

* Open questions
- typedefs
